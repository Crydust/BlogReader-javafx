This is the BlogReader in JavaFX 2.

You can see it in action on the [test page for BlogReader](http://crydust.github.com/BlogReader-javafx/dist/BlogReader.html).
It should look similar to the [Flex 2](http://www.crydust.be/blog/2006/12/26/blogreader/) and [AsWing](http://www.crydust.be/blog/2007/05/11/blogreader-in-aswing/) version.
This project is only meant as a coding exercise.
